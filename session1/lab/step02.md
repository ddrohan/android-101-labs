Press "Next" and then give the project a name: 'HelloWorld'

It's recommended you change the default package name also, (but you can leave it as it is this time) and accept the rest of the defaults, on the remaining screens.

and name it as in the screenshot below

After you press "Finish", you should now have something similar to the following:

Familiarise yourself with the project layout - the initial xml layout or "screen" is first displayed, this is one of the many resources you will be using and creating throughout this module. We will experiment later with modifying this layout, but first you should run the application.

Select the Project (HelloWorld)->Right-Mouse-Button->Run As->Android Application, as follows:

If you haven't done so already, you will be asked to select/create an AVD (Android Virtual Device), as follows:

and

Use the settings as above and your first Android App should launch like so, (Once you've unlocked the device!):
