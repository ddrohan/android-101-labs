This is where you can find all the labs for **Web Application Development**.

We will be covering the MEAN Software Stack which essentially covers Mongo, Express, Angular and Node when developing web applications.

The labs will begin with a simple Angular web app and progress on to a fully fledged MEAN web app, connected to a mongodb database hosted on [mongolab](http://www.mongolab.com) deployed to [heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

You can check out the completed web app here [http://donationweb.herokuapp.com](http://donationweb.herokuapp.com).
